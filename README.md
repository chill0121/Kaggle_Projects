# Kaggle Project Repository

Repository to house any casual tinkering in Kaggle competitions. 

Used mainly to lightly explore different data techniques.

## NLP_Disaster_Tweets

Competition Source: https://www.kaggle.com/c/nlp-getting-started/overview

This project is an exploration of deep learning techniques in the natural language processing (NLP), including: Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) and Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) based models. Using these methods to classify individual tweets as either referencing a real disaster (1) or not (0).

## Cancer_Detection_Histopathology

Competition Source: https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/histopathologic-cancer-detection/overview

This project is will take a Whole Slide Imaging (WSI) patches of lymphatic tissue in combination with Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to classify metastatic cancer. The focus of this project will be building a CNN and iterate through optimizing its architecture and hyperparameter tuning. Given the size of this dataset, a secondary focus of this project will be using a subset of the dataset to perform model tuning and selection on local hardware to then hopefully generalize well enough to be performant on the full test set.
